# 1. WOOD DESK
This was our first fusion work. We wanted to try with furnitures first. When we printed it, we had some issues with our raft, which was not holding well. Also the scale was a bit small. But we then saw how to put the right parameters for the next work.

# 2. BOOK SHELF
Our first trial with the 3d printer was a book shelf. This one turned out pretty well. We had to print it on its back so we can have a good raft set.

# 3. GROOVED KNOB
We also worked on the knob of a blender, which also turned out pretty well.

 # 4. PLANT POT
Our 4th Print was a pot plant. This was one of our experiment in line with our final Project. Unfortunately it didn't come out too great.
