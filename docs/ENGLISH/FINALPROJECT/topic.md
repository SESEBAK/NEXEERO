# OUR TOPIC
One of the ways to Solve World Hunger is by increasing Agricultural Output.
As Nexeero Group, our goal is to contribute to the Zero Hunger Project by bringing solutions to some agriculture issues like Irrigation, faced by Least developed countries. 

Some of the ideas we were having is to innovate or better some of the devices used in agriculture, in micro-irrigation for example. Especially agriculture sprinklers. We want to look at how we can innovate them in a way that they can be easily accessible by the lowly hence helping in bettering LDCs irrigation issues.
