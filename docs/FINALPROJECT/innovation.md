## BENEFITS:
- It saves Water: It provides the right amount of water and directs it to where it's supposed to be.
- It saves Time: In summer, watering by hand can be an extremely time-consuming process. You will usually need to water at least once a day, sometimes more, in hot weather. Many gardeners or plant owners simply do not have the time to keep up with this chore.
- It saves Effort from the plant owner: Beyond saving the gardener's time it also saves him effort.
- It reduces weeds:By making sure that water is directed to exactly where it is needed, a carefully designed automatic irrigation system can also reduce the number of weeds that you have to contend with. Weeds can often spring up to take advantage of errant watering that was provided soil moisture in gaps between plants.
- It protects the soil ecosystem: In addition to making life easier for the gardener and ensuring that their crops thrive, such a system also help to protect the whole ecosystem of the soil.
