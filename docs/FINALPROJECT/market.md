# What Is Sprinkler Irrigation?

Sprinkler irrigation is any irrigation that uses a pressurized system to apply water in a method that mimics rainfall to the soil surface.

Water is delivered to a farmer’s fields through a network of pipes or hoses, and the water is usually pressurized using a pumping system. Irrigation sprinkler systems may be temporary, movable or permanent.

In the United States, nearly 4.4 million acres are irrigated via some method of spray, aka sprinkler irrigation, not including center pivot or micro-spray irrigation, according to the 2018 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) report “Sprinkler Irrigation in the Fields and Open.”

Sprinkler irrigation is widely used because it is versatile, adaptable to almost all crops, and affordable. But it’s not a perfect irrigation system. Spray irrigation is one of the most inefficient watering methods, wasting approximately 30 to 50% of the water applied through run-off and evaporation. Only flood irrigation is a more potentially inefficient method of irrigation crops, whereas systems like drip irrigation and sub-irrigation use much less water to achieve effective application rates.

This is an essential consideration because worldwide, farmers are grappling with increasing drought, higher temperatures, and growing populations sucking up the planet’s finite water resources and resulting in restricted water access for agricultural purposes. According to a recently published study, water scarcity is predicted to become a more significant issue in more than 80% of the world’s croplands by 2050.

As farmers plan for their future, carefully considering the type of irrigation system they employ and exploring ways to maximize the efficiency of the system they install is becoming an increasingly critical component of successful farm management.

# 1. TYPES OF SPRINGLER IRRIGATION SYSTEMS

Several different types of spray irrigation systems are commonly employed for farm irrigation methods.

 ## Cable Tow System
A cable-tow system is a traveling gun irrigation system. It comprises a large sprinkler head connected to a flexible hose that runs to the water source. The sprinkler is installed on a wheeled cart and is propelled through the field by a cable that winds itself around a drum mounted on the cart.

Cable tow systems are helpful for many different crops but require a cleared lane to travel down and a stationary object at the end of the field, like a tractor, as an anchor.

 ## Hose-Pull Traveler System
A hose-pull traveler is similar to the cable tow but does not require a cable or a stationary object as an anchor. A hose-pull traveler irrigation system uses a wheeled cart installed with a gun-type sprinkler and a semi-rigid polyethylene hose that winds up on a large reel mounted on a second wheeled cart.

 ## Solid and Permanent Set Irrigation
Solid set irrigation systems are made up of evenly-spaced sprinkler heads mounted on risers along a length of pipe. They typically use impact sprinkler heads, although different types of sprinkler heads may be installed depending on the crop requirement. The line is above ground and is movable. These systems are most commonly used on smaller farms or high-value crops such as vegetables. Spacing and spray patterns are easily adjusted by switching out different spray heads or changing the space between risers.

 ## Micro-Sprinkler Systems
Micro-sprinkler systems are a low-pressure type of spray irrigation. However, they are typically classified together with drip irrigation because the system for delivery is the same. Micro-sprinklers are small, low-pressure sprinklers inserted into a small, typical ½-inch diameter mainline tube.

While sprinkler heads can be switched to adjust droplet size and spray, impact sprinklers aren’t utilized in micro-sprinkler systems because the system doesn’t deliver enough water pressure to pressurize an impact sprinkler.

 ## Center Pivot Irrigation
Center pivot irrigation systems are among the most commonly used irrigation systems, especially in the United States. They propel themselves around a central pivot point, creating the circular green fields standard throughout the Midwest.

Center pivot systems are quite large, capable of irrigating 125 to 130 acres. They are comprised of a lateral, stainless steel pipe mounted across mobile truss structures. Sprinkler heads are mounted along the length of the line, either directly from the overhead pipe or hanging down from lateral pipes. Center pivot systems are best used in circular fields as areas outside the circular pattern will not be irrigated.

 ## Linear Move Irrigation
A linear move irrigation system is similar to a center pivot system, but rather than pivoting around a central point, it moves laterally through a field. They work in a square or rectangular-shaped field.

# 2. PROS OF SPRINKLERS

  _ Sprinkler irrigation systems are flexible for many different crops, regions, and soil types. They can be designed to match the dimensions of a field and accommodate hills and uneven terrain, issues that challenge other irrigation systems like furrow irrigation. By swapping out different types of sprinkler heads or nozzles, changing the height of the risers sprinklers are mounted on, or adjusting the water pressure or even pipe size, farmers can change the diameter and impact of how water is applied to crops and the soil surface.

  _ Can Be Used to Apply Fertilizers and Chemicals

  _ Farmers can easily use their sprinkler irrigation system to fertilize or apply chemicals by including a fertigation or chemigation component in their irrigation system.
Delivers a Lot of Water When Needed

  _ Sprinkler irrigation systems are an excellent way to deliver much water when it is most needed uniformly across an area. For this reason, sprinkler irrigation systems are often set up in high-value crops like orchards or salad greens for secondary reasons—like cooling during hot weather or preventing cold weather damage during sudden freezes.
