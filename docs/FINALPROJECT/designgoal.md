# THE GOAL OF OUR DESIGN : Goal 2_Zero Hunger
One of the ways to Solve World Hunger is by increasing Agricultural Output.
As Nexeero Group, our goal is to contribute to the Zero Hunger Project by bringing solutions to some agriculture issues like Irrigation, faced by Least developed countries but also come up with ideas of devices that can be used in the everyday life of those having small gardens and plants.

Our design will be helping to make easier the life of those practicing gardening on a small scale henceforth encouraging them to also grow crops from their homes.
