# OUR TOPIC: AUTOMATIC WATERING SYSTEM (FOR PLANTS)
From that common goal we came to a decision of designing an Automated Water Irrigation System for small Gardens. We want to bring in a devise that is going to sense the moisture of the soil then send signals for the plant or garden to be refreshed. 

Through technologies we have been studying like Arduino, we will be able to connect some elements that are going to help in building this system.
