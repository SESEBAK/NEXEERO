# OUR TOPIC: AUTOMATIC WATERING SYSTEM (FOR PLANTS)
From those two common goals we came up with a decision of designing an Automated Plant Watering System which would make our topic 2 dimensional.
- ON A BIGGER SCALE: It would be an Automated Water Irrigation System. The device would work on big fields and would detect the moisture of the soil and then automatically provide water to the crops, which would help alot in Least Developed Countries because of the much sun that brings drought.

- ON A SMALLER SCALE: The device would help with indoor plants or small gardens and would distribute water when the sensor detects a low level of moisture.

## Our experiment is going to be on a small scale, which is AUTOMATIC SYSTEM FOR HOUSE PLANTS or for small Gardens. The device is going to sense the moisture of the soil then send signals for the plant or garden to be refreshed.

## Our design will be helping to make easier the life of those practicing gardening on a small scale henceforth encouraging them to also grow crops from their homes. Through technologies we have been studying like Arduino, we will be able to connect some elements that are going to help in building this system!!
